  <section class="mt-10">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="mt-5">
      A <strong>Visual Key (VKEYNFT)</strong> is an NFT that represents ownership of a specific Ethereum address. The
      NFT's token ID is the address it represents, creating a
      permanent on-chain link between the collectible and a digital identity.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      The rarity of each Visual Key is not artificial; it's based on mathematical probability. When an address
      is visualized, its pattern is made of colored squares. Rarity is primarily determined by its <strong>Level</strong>,
      which measures how many of the very first squares in the grid are red (technically, how many
      "leading zero bits" the address has). Finding an address that starts with a long sequence of these is
      exponentially harder, making it verifiably rare.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      Additionally, an NFT's distinction can be increased by committing <strong>VisualKey (VKEY)</strong> tokens to it.
      This sets its <strong>Power</strong>, a secondary rarity factor. This allows an address
      to be claimed and represented as a unique digital asset.

    <h2>Core Features</h2>

    <h3 class="mt-5">Direct On-Chain Link</h3>

    <p class="mt-5">
      The NFT's unique identifier is the Ethereum address it
      represents. This creates a direct and verifiable on-chain link that signifies ownership.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-5">The Minting Process</h3>

    <p class="mt-5">
      The minting process for a Visual Key NFT is designed for security and value:
    </p>

    <ul class="mt-3">
      <li>
        <strong>Proof of Ownership:</strong> To mint a Visual Key NFT for a specific address, the
        minter must provide an EIP-712 compliant signature (`tokenSignature`) generated
        using the private key of that address. This cryptographically proves control over the address, ensuring
        only its owner can create the corresponding NFT.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Setting Initial Power:</strong> The amount of VisualKey (VKEY) tokens
        committed during minting sets the NFT's initial "Power". A higher Power can
        signify greater distinction within its Level. The Power of an already minted NFT can also be increased by
        committing more VKEY.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Deflationary VKEY Mechanism:</strong> A key deflationary mechanic is that 100% of
        the VKEY tokens used to set or increase an NFT's Power are permanently burned
        (removed from the total supply) by the VKEY token contract. Every NFT
        minted or powered up contributes to VKEY's scarcity.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Gas-Efficient Transactions:</strong> The process of committing VKEY is
        streamlined. EIP-2612 Permit support (`paymentSignature`) allows the VKEY tokens to be approved for
        use in the same transaction as the mint or power-up, which avoids a separate
        "approve" transaction and reduces gas fees.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="mt-5">Rarity Factors</h3>

    <p class="mt-5">
      Each Visual Key has unique characteristics recorded on-chain at the time of minting, which determine its
      rarity:
    </p>

    <ul class="mt-3">
      <li>
        <strong>Level:</strong> The Level of each NFT is calculated based on the number of leading
        zero bits in the 160-bit Ethereum address in its raw binary form. More leading
        zero bits are statistically harder to find, making higher Level NFTs inherently rarer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Power:</strong> This is determined by the total amount of VKEY tokens
        committed to the NFT, both at minting and through any subsequent power increases. It acts as a secondary
        rarity factor within each Level.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Creation Time:</strong> A timestamp marking the exact moment the Visual Key NFT
        was created on the blockchain, giving it a unique, verifiable place in history.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-5">
      Rarity is primarily determined by Level (higher is rarer). Within the same Level, NFTs with higher Power are
      considered more distinguished. If two NFTs share the same Level and Power, the one with the earlier Creation
      Time is considered rarer.
      Additionally, the Power of an NFT isn't static; it can be increased post-mint by committing more
      VKEY tokens, which enhances its distinction.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-5">Technical Standards</h3>

    <ul class="mt-3">
      <li>
        Based on the <strong>ERC721 standard</strong>, ensuring
        compatibility with NFT marketplaces, wallets, and other dApps.
      </li>
      <li>
        Implements <strong>ERC721Enumerable</strong> for on-chain tracking and enumeration of
        all Visual Key NFTs and those owned by a specific address.
      </li>
      <li>
        Supports <strong>ERC721Metadata</strong> to provide detailed information about each NFT. The token URI is
        dynamically generated to include Level, Power, and Mint Date.
      </li>
      <li>
        Utilizes <strong>EIP-5267</strong> for EIP-712 domain
        separators for verifying digital signatures.
      </li>
      <li>
        Implements <strong>ERC7572</strong> to provide a `contractURI`, pointing to
        contract-level metadata.
      </li>
      <li>
        Emits <strong>ERC4906-compatible `MetadataUpdate` events</strong> whenever an NFT's
        attributes (like Power) change, enabling marketplaces and applications to refresh and display the
        latest information.
      </li>
      <li>
        Managed with an <strong>ERC173-compliant ownership system</strong>. To enhance security,
        ownership transfers require a two-step process: an owner initiates a transfer, and the designated new owner
        must wait 16 days before they can complete the transfer. The current owner can also cancel a pending transfer.
        This security measure applies to both the NFT and the VKEY token contracts.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Synergy between NFTs and VKEY Token</h2>

    <p class="mt-5">
      Visual Key NFTs and the VisualKey Token (VKEY) are designed to work in synergy, creating a self-sustaining
      ecosystem:
    </p>

    <ul class="mt-3">
      <li>
        <strong>Primary Utility:</strong> The VKEY token is the
        exclusive token used to mint Visual Key NFTs and to subsequently increase their Power.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Deflationary Pressure:</strong> The burning mechanism is a central feature.
        Every VKEY token used for minting or powering up is permanently removed from circulation.
        As more users engage with Visual Key NFTs, the total supply of VKEY decreases, which is
        designed to influence its scarcity and market dynamics.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ecosystem Driver:</strong> Visual Key NFTs provide a core
        utility for the VKEY token, intended to drive its adoption and use within the VisualKey
        ecosystem.
      </li>
