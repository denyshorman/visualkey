      The Utility Token for the VisualKey Ecosystem
    </p>
  </header>

  <section class="mt-10">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="mt-5">
      <strong>VisualKey (VKEY)</strong> is the official utility token of the VisualKey ecosystem. It is the primary
      token required to use the platform's features, such as creating and enhancing <strong>Visual Key
      NFTs</strong>.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      VKEY is designed with deflationary mechanics. When VKEY is used to mint a new NFT or increase its
      Power, those tokens are permanently removed from circulation (<strong>burned</strong>). This creates a
      direct link between platform activity and the total supply of VKEY.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      VKEY is an ERC20 token with advanced features like flash loans and gas-less approvals for more efficient
      transactions.
    </p>
  </section>

    <h2>Core Features</h2>

    <h3 class="mt-8">Controlled Supply Expansion</h3>

    <p class="mt-5">
      To support ecosystem growth, the VisualKey Token incorporates a mechanism for periodic supply increases,
      managed by the token owner. This allows for the introduction of new VKEY tokens in
      a transparent and predictable manner:
    </p>

    <ul class="mt-3">
      <li>Approximately every 16 days, the token owner has the option to mint a new batch
        of 1,048,576 VKEY.
      </li>
      <li>This minting opportunity is available for a 24-hour window following each
        16-day interval. Unused minting opportunities do not accumulate.
      </li>
      <li>The minting process is secured by a cryptographic signature from the owner to ensure authorized operations.
        This capability can also be permanently disabled by the token owner.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-5">
      This controlled inflation model allows for strategic funding of new initiatives and community rewards.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-5">Deflationary Mechanisms</h3>

    <p class="mt-5">
      The VisualKey Token includes several features that contribute to its scarcity over time:
    </p>

    <ul class="mt-3">
      <li>
        <strong>Standard Burn Functionality:</strong> Token holders can permanently remove their VKEY
        from circulation using standard burn functions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Flash Loan Fee Burning:</strong> The fee collected from EIP-3156 compliant flash loans is automatically
        burned, reducing the total supply with each transaction.
      </li>
      <li><strong>VKEY Burn on NFT Minting & Power-Ups:</strong> All VKEY tokens
        committed to mint a new Visual Key (VKEYNFT) or to increase an existing
        NFT's "Power" are permanently burned. This creates a
        direct link between the growth of the NFT ecosystem and the scarcity of VKEY.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-5">
      These mechanisms ensure that activity within the VisualKey ecosystem contributes
      to a decreasing token supply.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-5">Utility in the Visual Keys (VKEYNFT) Ecosystem</h3>

    <p class="mt-5">
      <strong>VKEY</strong> is integral to the Visual Keys NFT platform:
    </p>

    <ul class="mt-3">
      <li>Visual Keys NFTs transform unique Ethereum addresses into verifiable
        digital collectibles, where the NFT's ID is the address itself.
      </li>
      <li>The "Power" attribute of a VKEYNFT, a key rarity factor, is determined by the amount of VKEY
        committed (and subsequently burned) during its minting and any subsequent power-up events.
      </li>
      <li>VKEY directly influences the distinction and potential desirability of each Visual Keys NFT.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="mt-5">Future Utility</h3>

    <p class="mt-5">
      <strong>VKEY</strong> is designed to be the primary token for future projects and services
      within the expanding digital landscape, ensuring its sustained relevance and utility.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-5">Technical Standards</h3>

    <p class="mt-5">The VisualKey Token is built with a robust set of features for security, efficiency, and advanced
      interactions:</p>

    <ul class="mt-3">
      <li>
        <strong>Gas-less Approvals (EIP-2612 Permit)</strong>: Users can approve token spending
        via signatures, which can save on transaction fees and improve user experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Collateral-Free Loans (EIP-3156 Flash Loans)</strong>: Allows for instant,
        uncollateralized borrowing of VKEY, provided the loan is repaid within the same transaction. The fee for such
        loans is configurable by the owner and is burned upon successful execution.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Enhanced Token Interactions (ERC1363)</strong>: Supports `transferAndCall` and
        `approveAndCall` functionalities, allowing VKEY to interact with smart contracts in a single transaction.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Secure Ownership (ERC173)</strong>: Implements a secure ownership model with a
        16-day waiting period for ownership transfers of the token
        contract. The current owner can also cancel a pending transfer. The owner also has capabilities for emergency
        withdrawals of other tokens sent to the contract and for managing flash loan fees, all secured via signature.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Standardized Domain Separator (EIP-5267)</strong>: Ensures compatibility and security
        for EIP-712 signature verifications.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Synergy with Visual Keys NFTs</h2>

    <p class="mt-5">
      VisualKey Token (VKEY) and Visual Keys NFTs are intrinsically linked to our VisualKey tool.
    </p>

    <ul class="mt-3">
      <li>
        <strong>Address Generation:</strong> The VisualKey tool allows users to generate a unique Ethereum private key
        and its corresponding public address from a visual pattern.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Claiming an Address:</strong> A Visual Keys (VKEYNFT) represents one of these
        addresses as a permanent, collectible asset on the blockchain, where the NFT's ID is the
        address itself.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>VKEY as a Catalyst:</strong> To mint a Visual Keys NFT and
        to later increase its "Power", VKEY is required. The VKEY tokens used in this process
        are then burned, contributing to the token's scarcity.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-5">
      This synergy allows users to transform visual creations into verifiably scarce digital assets, with VKEY
      serving as the primary catalyst.

    <h2>Acquiring VKEY</h2>

    <p class="mt-5">
      VKEY tokens are required to interact with the VisualKey ecosystem. There are a few ways to
      acquire them.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-5">Direct Purchase via Smart Contract</h3>

    <p class="mt-5">
      The primary method to acquire VKEY is by purchasing them directly through our secure, owner-managed smart
      contract.
      This allows you to buy tokens using ETH at a price determined by the contract owner. The owner can adjust the
      price (wei per VKEY) to reflect market conditions.

    <div class="mt-5">
      <a [routerLink]="['/token/acquire']"

      </a>
    </div>

    <h3 class="mt-5">Community & Early Supporter Rewards</h3>

    <p class="mt-5">
      To bootstrap the ecosystem, free VKEY tokens are available for early adopters and active community members.
      Contact the project creator for more information.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-5">Future: Exchange Listings</h3>

    <p class="mt-5">
      Future plans include listing VKEY on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). This will enable wider market access and
      provide greater liquidity for all token holders.
