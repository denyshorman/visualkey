    <p class="mt-5">
      This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the
      VisualKey Service and tells you about your privacy rights. The Service is
      provided by the project creator ("the Creator", "We", "Us", or "Our").

    <h2>Data Handling and Your Privacy</h2>

    <h3 class="mt-5">Private Key Generation and Usage</h3>
    <p class="mt-5">
      The core tools of the Service, such as the "Visualizer Tool", "Find Rare
      Keys", and "Vanity Address Generator", create Ethereum private keys and
      addresses. This entire process is performed <strong>exclusively in your browser on
      your local machine.</strong>
    </p>
    <ul class="mt-3">
      <li>
        <strong>We never see, store, or transmit your private keys.</strong> They
        are generated and exist only on your computer.
      </li>
      <li>
        To improve user experience when moving between pages (e.g., from finding a
        rare key to minting it), the generated private key may be temporarily
        stored in your browser's `sessionStorage`. This storage is local to your
        browser and is automatically cleared when you close the browser tab.
      </li>
      <li>
        You are solely responsible for the secure management of any private keys
        you generate and choose to save.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="mt-5">Blockchain Interactions</h3>
    <p class="mt-5">
      For on-chain transactions like buying, burning, or minting tokens, the
      Service helps you interact with your own third-party wallet (e.g.,
      MetaMask).
    </p>
    <ul class="mt-3">
      <li>
        Your private keys are managed securely by your wallet provider and are
        never exposed to our Service.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your public wallet address and all transaction details are permanently
        recorded on the public blockchain. We do not control this public data.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="mt-5">Usage Analytics</h3>
    <p class="mt-5">
      We use Google Analytics to collect anonymous usage data to understand how
      users interact with the Service. This helps us improve features and user
      experience. This data may include:
    </p>
    <ul class="mt-3">
      <li>
        Your device's IP address, browser type, and operating system.
      </li>
      <li>The pages you visit and the time you spend on them.</li>
      <li>The features you use and the buttons you click.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-5">
      This information is aggregated and does not personally identify you. We do
      not use this data for advertising. You can opt-out of Google Analytics
      tracking by using the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.

    <p class="mt-5">
      Our Service is not directed to anyone under the age of 13. We do not
      knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under
      13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has
      provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that
      we have collected Personal Data from a child under 13 without verification

      of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100%
